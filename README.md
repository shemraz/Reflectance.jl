# Reflectance

[![Build Status](https://github.com/shemraz/Reflectance.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/shemraz/Reflectance.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amaster)

Reflectance is a Julia package for working with Polynomial Texture Maps (PTMs), providing tools to read, manipulate, and analyse surface reflectance data in computational research.

## Overview

[Polynomial Texture Mapping](https://doi.org/10.1145/383259.383320) (PTM) is a computational photography technique that captures a subject's surface shape and colour by taking multiple photographs with varying light directions. Reflectance.jl aims to make these datasets accessible within the Julia ecosystem.

## Development Roadmap

**Current Status**: Early development

**Planned Functionality**:
- PTM file format parsing
- Coefficient extraction
- Light vector adjustment
- Basic rendering functionality
- Simple image export
- Normal map generation

## Basic Usage

The package is currently under initial development. Usage examples will be provided as functionality is implemented.

## Documentation

Documentation will be developed alongside the package functionality.
